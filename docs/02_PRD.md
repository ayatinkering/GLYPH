# 02 — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **GLYPH**
>
> *Every walk leaves behind a Mandala Commit.*

Version: 1.0

Product Stage: Hackathon MVP

Platform: Mobile-First Progressive Web App

# Product Overview

GLYPH is a computational medium for movement.

Instead of tracking activity, GLYPH transforms every walk into a deterministic mathematical artifact called a **Mandala Commit**.

Every footstep contributes to a living procedural mandala rendered using computational geometry.

The sky determines the visual atmosphere.

The rhythm of the user's gait becomes procedural percussion.

When the walk ends, GLYPH generates a numbered Mandala Commit that can be downloaded as a museum-quality artwork or optionally committed to GitHub.

Unlike fitness applications, GLYPH celebrates creativity rather than performance.

---

# Problem Statement

Modern software developers spend most of their day creating digital artifacts.

- Code
- Pull Requests
- Design files
- Documents
- APIs

Every hour spent inside VS Code is permanently recorded.

Yet the simple act of stepping outside leaves behind nothing.

Walking improves creativity, mental clarity and problem solving, yet existing walking applications reduce it to statistics.

```
10,382 Steps

6.8 km

412 Calories
```

Those numbers are quickly forgotten.

GLYPH asks:

**Can movement become something worth keeping?**

---

# Vision

Create a new computational medium where movement becomes mathematics.

The application should encourage developers to leave their desk, spend time outside, and return with something beautiful.

Not achievements.

Not fitness badges.

A computational artifact.

---

# One-Line Pitch

> GitHub records the code you wrote.
>
> GLYPH records the moments you chose to step outside.

---

# Product Goals

## Primary Goal

Transform every walk into a deterministic mathematical Mandala Commit.

---

## Secondary Goals

Encourage developers to walk regularly.

Celebrate computational art.

Create beautiful shareable artifacts.

Make mathematics approachable.

Introduce GitHub as a creative archive rather than only a software archive.

---

# Non Goals

GLYPH is NOT

- a running tracker
- a calorie counter
- a social network
- a competitive leaderboard
- an AI image generator
- a journaling app
- a map application
- a route recorder
- a health platform

---

# Target Audience

Primary

Developers

Design engineers

Creative coders

Artists

Students

People who appreciate computational design

---

Secondary

Anyone who enjoys walking

People interested in generative art

Nature lovers

Creative professionals

---

# Core Product Pillars

## 1. Computational Beauty

Every pixel should originate from mathematics.

No AI generated visuals.

---

## 2. Minimal Interaction

The user should spend their time walking.

Not interacting with the app.

---

## 3. Physical Creativity

Movement becomes creation.

Walking becomes drawing.

---

## 4. Lasting Artifacts

Every walk deserves to become something permanent.

---

# User Story

Ayat is working on a difficult programming problem.

She has been coding for five hours.

She opens GLYPH.

Presses Start.

Puts the phone in her pocket.

Walks for twenty minutes.

The application quietly computes her movement.

When she returns she receives

Mandala Commit #0047.

She downloads it.

Commits it to GitHub.

Shares the artwork.

Closes the app.

# Definition of Success

A successful GLYPH demo is not measured by the number of features.

It is measured by one reaction:

The user finishes a short walk.

The Mandala blooms.

The beat fades into silence.

The Commit appears.

The user looks at the artifact and thinks:

> "I can't believe *my movement* created this."

That moment is the product.

Everything else exists to support it.

---

## Final Product Statement

GLYPH introduces a new kind of digital artifact.

The **Mandala Commit**.

A deterministic computational record of movement, generated from mathematics rather than artificial intelligence.

Every walk becomes a permanent piece of computational art.

Every Commit is proof that, for a moment, you stepped away from the screen—and the world became part of the computation.
